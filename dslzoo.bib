The grammar was reverse engineered based on an incomplete EBNF-like grammar specification in the user manual, as well as several KRL example programs. To be able to map KRL (legacy) code to a more expressive Java robot interface called RoboticAPI, a mapping from KRL statements to RoboticAPI calls was implemented.
A tree-based and a bytecode-based KRL interpreter are implemented and benchmarked in terms of performance.},

  abstract={This paper introduces a novel task description language for human-robot interaction in warehouse logistics to let human workers interact with robots in a natural way. Especially, in decentralized control systems with heterogeneous entities, humans have to retain control over the overall system. This work offers a simple way to build up teams consisting of humans and robots to efficiently use the capabilities of humans as well as robots. With the proposed system it is also possible to provide multi vendor-capabilities and allow an easy integration of robots. We are providing a solution, starting from the user input, converting it into a domain specific language and showing also the execution in human-robot collaboration.},
